In the same year, National Grid reported 14.89 MMTherms in net incremental gas savings, representing 1.60% of its annual retail sales. To achieve these savings, National Grid spent $104,899,957 on natural gas energy efficiency programs, which is normalized to $128.62 per residential customer. These spending and savings values are for the utilities’ entire Massachusetts service territory, not just Boston. Eversource offers electric efficiency incentives and technical assistance to residential and commercial/industrial customers. National Grid similarly offers natural gas efficiency programs to residential and business customers. Both utilities also sponsor whole-building programs, including multifamily buildings, through the state-wide Mass Save program. Their “whole facility” approach focuses on a facility’s thermal envelope (shell insulation and air leakage conditions for units heated by natural gas or electricity) as well as lighting and mechanical systems.

The City of Boston partners with its energy utilities through the Renew Boston program. Renew Boston promotes energy efficient choices and informs Boston residents and businesses about utility-sponsored energy efficiency services. Through its community-centric outreach and education, Renew Boston helps ensure that the City's diverse homes and businesses are connected to available energy efficiency programs and incentives. Eversource continues to lend the City a manager that aids the City with energy efficiency project uptake and implementation. Moreover, the City and utilities are partnering on a joint marketing effort to increase residential home energy efficiency activities in Boston’s low- and middle income neighborhoods, with a focus on increasing home energy audits, weatherization, and heating system upgrades.

The City of Boston also takes an active role in advising the utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs through a seat on the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council (EEAC). The Massachusetts Green Communities Act of 2008 created the EEAC to assist in the development and implementation of the statewide gas and electric utility energy efficiency plans. These plans set three-year targets for electricity and natural gas savings. The EEAC did not include representation from Massachusetts' municipal governments until Boston advocated for the addition of a voting seat for an individual representing ""a city or town of the Commonwealth"" through An Act Relative to Competitively Priced Electricity in the Commonwealth.

The Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) and Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) fund water efficiency programs available to all water customers. While BWSC does not directly issue rebates and incentives under the MassSave program, Boston’s energy utilities—National Grid and Eversource Energy—do offer rebates and incentives for water saving technologies. Notably, Boston customers are offered no-cost water-efficiency kits that include kitchen and bathroom faucet aerators, a low-flow replacement showerhead, a water-efficiency gauge to test showerheads and sinks, and dye tablets to check for toilet leaks. Water demand in the MWRA territory has decreased by nearly a third since the 1980s, in part through efficiency initiatives. Although no community-wide water savings target have been adopted by the city or its utilities, the MWRA has a comprehensive, long-term strategy for water savings as described in their 2013 Water System Master Plan. 

Energy Efficiency and Self-Generation

MWRA has completed energy audits at 33 of its 36 major facilities. Implementation of audit recommendations and other process optimization efforts is estimated to save almost $2 million annually as part of its Long Term Sustainability Program. MWRA continues to reduce its electrical demand by optimizing process operations and renewable generation—including wind, solar, hydroelectric and biogas—and implementation of energy efficiency measures. Over the past 5 years, they have achieved a reduction of over 10% or a total of 18M kWh. Recently, MWRA entered into a memorandum of agreement with Eversource to identify and implement energy efficiency opportunities throughout MWRA's day-to-day operations and construction programs, and also to achieve higher rebates from the utility for implementing energy efficiency projects. MWRA also calls out Environmental Sustainability as a key strategic priority in their Five-Year Strategic Business Plan for FY 2016–2020. These initiatives include continuing to audit all facilities on their regular audit schedule, optimization of processes, cost effective renewable energy deployments, continued maximization of GHG reductions and fully leveraging all available utility rebates and incentives for energy efficiency. Finally, MWRA self-generates approximately 33 million kWh/year from methane capture at the Deer Island wastewater treatment plant.

Green Stormwater Infrastructure

Boston Water and Sewer Commission issued a Stormwater Best Management Practices Implementation Plan, with distinct recommendations and references to Green Infrastructure Demonstration projects including City Hall Plaza and Central Square in East Boston. In addition, BWSC is in the process of drafting a Green Infrastructure plan for stormwater runoff, which should be released within the next year.

Under BWSC’s site plan requirements, developers designing new development and re-development projects must fully investigate methods for retaining or infiltrating stormwater on-site before the commission will consider a plan to discharge stormwater to its system. The commission’s 2015–2017 capital improvement program includes $1,350,000 to install stormwater BMPs and green infrastructure components in three areas of the city.

The City of Boston also requires that almost all new or major renovation projects within the district include groundwater recharge (see, Groundwater Conservation Overlay District (GCOD)). Working with the BWSC, a project must demonstrate the required amount of recharge capacity, how much recharge is being provided, and locations of the supply and overflow lines along with any connections to BWSC lines. Typically, all projects must be able to recharge the first inch of rain.

","Water Efficiency

Although Chicago’s water and energy utilities do not run joint water and energy efficiency programs, Chicago’s city-run MeterSave program provides significant incentives to the community. Through the MeterSave program, the city’s Department of Water Management supplies a free water meter to unmetered residents and business customers, and guarantees bills will be lower than the estimated rate for 7 years post installation. The City of Chicago also offers rain barrels and indoor or outdoor conservation kits to homeowners.

The City of Chicago has a goal to decrease water use by 2% annually, according to the Sustainable Chicago 2015 plan.  The City of Chicago also has a program to aggressively replace old water mains, thus reducing water loss from leaking pipes. Through Building a New Chicago, DWM is replacing 900 miles of water main—most of which are over 100 years old—over a 10-year period.

Energy Efficiency and Self-Generation

Both the Department of Water Management (DWM) and Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) have extensive programs to increase energy efficiency across operations, and are pursuing energy efficiency initiatives. DWM is converting several steam-powered turbines and boilers at five pumping stations in the water distribution system to electricity, saving more than $6.4 million/year in energy costs, with additional savings from lower operating costs, and a greenhouse gas emission reduction of 75%. The conversion of the pumping stations from steam to electricity are part of the “Building a New Chicago” program. 

MWRD has also implemented a sewer thermal heat and cooling system to save energy at its water reclamation plant, where methane is also collected for electricity generation. Moreover, the MWRD operates several anaerobic digesters, generating up to one-third of its energy from the digestion process. A new project will divert 440 tons a day of food waste from the city of Chicago’s solid waste stream, feed it into the digesters at the Calumet treatment plant in Chicago, generate 160% more methane gas, and sell some of this gas back into the natural gas pipeline.

Green Stormwater Infrastructure

In 2014, the city released a comprehensive Green Stormwater Infrastructure Strategy that aims to use green infrastructure investments to manage Chicago’s stormwater runoff. In 2014, under this plan, $50 million from the city’s capital budget was allocated over the next 5 years to fund green stormwater infrastructure projects on municipally-owned sites. Examples of initiatives include the city of Chicago’s Rain Ready program, which offers information and resources to help homes and businesses become rain ready and protected from flooding. The program also offers water conservation and efficiency information. The City provides free rain barrels as part of the MeterSave program as an incentive to install water meters and conserve water. The City’s Stormwater ordinance requires private property owners to provide onsite water infiltration for new and major developments, which strongly encourage green infrastructure projects. The City of Chicago’s Department of Forestry also has an extensive program to plant and protect trees throughout the city, with more than 26,000 trees planted since 2011. MWRD also has a stormwater management program with nineteen goals in place.

As part of this goal, Cleveland set targets to reduce total energy consumption across all city departments 5% below 2010 levels by 2016, 10% below 2010 levels by 2020, and 20% below 2010 levels by 2030. The city also has a goal under DOE’s Better Buildings Challenge that includes municipal buildings.

Stringency

In order to meet its local government goal, Cleveland would need to reduce emissions by 2% per year.

Progress

We did not find quantitative data indicating Cleveland was on track to achieve its nearest-term local government emissions goal.

Reporting

Cleveland annually reports its greenhouse gas emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project and annually reports building energy usage in a sampling of buildings as required by their Better Buildings goal.

Green Stormwater Infrastructure

Kansas City began a pilot program called Middle Blue River Basin Green Solutions Pilot Project in 2012. The project is a part of Kansas City’s Overflow Control Program. Kansas City is invested in providing a healthy city with more sustainable infrastructure by reducing sewage and rainwater overflow. The pilot project took place in a neighborhood in south Kansas City. The result from this project has earned Kansas City the Envision Platinum Award from the Institute of Sustainable Infrastructure.

Kansas City’s consent decree with the EPA gives the city 25 years to develop systems that will capture and treat 88% of combined sewer overflows and eliminate sanitary sewer overflows during a five-year rain event. In response, the city developed an Overflow Control Plan and Program, a 25-year plan beginning in 2010. The plan outlines the implementation of green infrastructure projects and postpones the construction of huge underground rainwater detention systems for about 14 years.

In addition, Executive Order 109 of 2007 contains an energy savings target for municipal operations. Within New York City's government, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) Energy Management (DEM) group is responsible for implementing the long term plan to achieve the city’s local government greenhouse gas reduction goal. Their focus is on two building energy efficiency program areas that are expected to be responsible for more than half of municipal greenhouse gas reductions, namely building retrofits and improvements to building operations and maintenance as well as a significant upgrade to the city’s vehicle fleet.

Last updated: April 2017
","Executive Order 109 of 2007 formally adopted a goal to reduce municipal greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption 30% below 2005 levels by 2017, from FY 2006 (30 x 17 Plan). Through the One City, Built to Last: Transforming New York City’s Buildings for a Low-Carbon Future plan, released in 2014, New York set a new municipal emissions target of 35% by 2025, from FY 2006 levels. This is an interim goal to lead by example in working to achieve the overall citywide goal of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as finalized in Local Law 66 of 2014. Also as part of this plan, the City of New York publicly committed to investing over $1 billion to complete efficiency improvements in every municipal building with significant energy use (i.e. buildings that use over 5 MMBTU annually) by 2025. These goals were solidified in the passing of 2014 Local Law 66 of the New York City Council

Stringency

To meet their greenhouse gas reduction goal, New York City would need to reduce emissions by 1.5% per year.

Progress

New York City is currently on track for its local government greenhouse gas goal.

Reporting

Greenhouse gas inventories and progress reports are published annually and New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) publicly reports on progress toward local government initiatives on a city webpage. The City reports on progress publicly through the annual Inventory of New York City Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which is Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC) compliant, and other regularly released policy documents. The most recent policy update was provided as part of the 80 x 50 Roadmap. In addition, an annual update to OneNYC is also released to report on progress. According to most recent inventory of emissions released in 2015, local government emissions decreased by 17.3% since fiscal year 2006.

New York City has legislated fuel efficiency for public fleet vehicles, Local Law 38 of 2005 requires that the most fuel efficient vehicles in class for light and medium duty units be purchased; Local Law 76 of 2013 requires the City to achieve specific benchmarks in improving the fuel economy of City owned vehicles;  Local Law 73 of 2013 requires that biodiesel be used in City fleet trucks and also that the City retrofit or replace fleet trucks without diesel particulate filters; and Local Law 75 of 2013 requires the City to report on actual fuel economy for City vehicles, as opposed to the manufacturer’s list fuel economy.   Additionally, as part of the NYC Clean Fleet initiative to reduce GHG emissions by 50% by 2025, this city is planned to operate the largest EV fleet in the country at 2,000+ vehicles. The city has already purchased over 500 EV municipal vehicles. Furthermore, this city implemented a Clean Fleet Transition Policy (CFTP) as part of its published Fleet Management Manual and rules.  The CFTP requires that all vehicle replacements be as or more fuel efficient than the vehicle they will replace and that the Chief Fleet Officer approves any requests to replace any vehicle with a less fuel efficient version. As for web-based tracking technology, New York City uses NYC Fleet Focus which tracks all their vehicles in order to promote their efficient use. 

Note: For local fleet initiatives, policies listed must make a specific, mandatory requirement for increasing fleet efficiency. Local alternative-fuel vehicle procurement requirements that give a voluntary option to count efficient vehicles are thus not included.

Public Lighting

We could not confirm if New York City has adopted a policy requiring efficient outdoor lighting, such as the International Dark-Sky Association’s Model Lighting Ordinance. However, the city publishes a Street Design Manual, which includes a Lighting Catalogue, outlining options for both new and replacement street and pedestrian lighting for New York City. Additionally, the City of New York provides significant funding for lighting upgrades, including occupancy sensors, daylighting and other controls at City buildings.  To date over $63 Million has been allocated for lighting-related upgrades at municipal buildings. The Department of Transportation is currently retrofitting all of New York City's street lights with LEDs. By the end of 2017 all 250,000 standard street light fixtures in New York City are projected to be replaced. 

New Buildings and Equipment

New York City’s Local Laws 31 and 32 of 2016 require that projects receiving more than $2 million in city funding achieve LEED Gold certification. The building requirements apply to new construction, building additions, and substantial reconstructions of existing buildings for all city-funded projects.

","Building Benchmarking and Retrofitting

In December 2009, the city council passed four laws, collectively known as the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan, that require energy efficiency upgrades to and energy transparency in large existing buildings. In compliance with Local Law 84 of 2009, benchmarking results are reported for all city buildings that are more than 10,000 gross square feet that are owned by the city or for which the city pays all or part of the annual energy bill. In 2015, there was a total of 3,649 benchmarked facilities (288 million square feet), As a result, 95% of local government building square footage is benchmarked in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager. The city conducts energy audits and retro-commissioning studies to measure the energy performance of its portfolio and identify opportunities for retrofits. The city then prioritizes buildings with the greatest opportunity for energy savings through a comprehensive retrofit targeting city buildings with the largest energy demands and most complex energy consuming systems. The city’s building retrofit program has completed over 190 comprehensive building energy efficiency retrofit projects to date, with annual energy cost reductions of nearly $10.5 million. In addition, through the City’s Accelerated Conservation & Efficiency (ACE) program, the City invests in high-value energy efficiency projects in all its buildings. Since it launched in June 2013, ACE has awarded over $362 million for energy efficiency projects that are projected to yield $49.5 million in avoided energy costs and approximately 125,800 metric tons of CO2e emissions reduced.

","Water Efficiency

While the City of New York, which is a municipal water utility, does not jointly administer energy and water efficiency programs with private energy utilities, the energy utilities themselves offer water efficiency programs as a way to reduce both water and energy usage. Consolidated Edison provides energy-efficient and low-flow devices through their energy efficiency programs. National Grid has a Commercial Direct Install Program, which offers commercial customers no-cost installation of high-efficiency water and energy savings measures.

In 2014, NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) released the Water Demand Management Plan, a citywide program targeting a 5% overall reduction in water consumption citywide by year 2021. The plan consists of multiple strategies and more than 21 initiatives to achieve a target reduction of approximately 50 million gallons per day.

The Municipal Water Efficiency Program provides funding for water conservation and water efficiency projects in city-owned facilities. Under this program, DEP has identified opportunities for water savings in more than 2,000 city properties, with estimated water savings of over 9 million gallons of water per day by the end of the program. DEP has retrofitted 370 of 400 spray showers in City parks and installed high-efficiency fixtures in 240 schools to date; retrofits for 500 schools are planned.  The porcelain from the schools is being recycled for an oyster bed project in Jamaica Bay as well as green infrastructure bioswales. DEP has also had success with its Water Challenge to waste water treatment plants, achieving 300,000 gallons per day in savings among 3 plants in 2015.

Under the Residential Water Efficiency Program, DEP launched a two year Toilet Replacement Program in 2014. Phase I of the program offers $125 vouchers for qualified multifamily property owners who replace outdated toilets with high-efficiency models. Approximately 1,300 vouchers for approximately 14,200 toilets in total have been requested thus far. 

The Non-Residential Water Efficiency Program promotes conservation in commercial and non-residential buildings through partnerships with the private sector. In the spring of 2013, DEP and the Mayor’s Office launched a water efficiency program called the New York City Water Challenge to Hotels, where eleven of the city’s premier hotels were challenged to reduce their consumption by 5% below 2012 levels. Similar programs targeting restaurants in 2015, and hospitals in 2016 are yielding meaningful water savings.

Additional DEP strategies under the Water Demand Management Program include Water Distribution System Optimization, Water Supply Shortage Management, and an Upstate Water Conservation Program. Most recently, DEP is developing a demand management program with our wholesale upstate customers. The first phase of this program is the provision of consulting services to assist upstate customers in developing demand management plans; the second phase will be the implementation of such plans. Demand management plans have been developed for eight upstate customers: The Village of Ossining, the Village of Tarrytown, Westchester Joint Water Works, the City of Mt. Vernon, the Village of Scarsdale, the Town of New Windsor, the Town of Greenburgh, and SUEZ Water Westchester (formerly United Water Westchester) that serves New Rochelle and other communities in lower Westchester.

Energy Efficiency and Self-Generation

DEP completed energy audits at all 14 in-city wastewater treatment plants and has accepted over 130 energy conservation measures (ECMs) that have the potential to reduce energy use by 2.9 MMBTU per year. While there is no set annual “target” for energy efficiency, the Agency is currently working on an integration study to align those ECMs with State of Good Repair (SOGR) plans and projects so that ECMs are completed concurrently with ongoing, necessary maintenance and repair work at the 14 in-city plants. Additionally, DEP has a target to beneficially use 60% its anaerobic digester gas for thermal and/or electric energy by 2017. DEP currently produces over 3.5 billion cubic feet of anaerobic digester gas (ADG) per year, approximately 60% of which is made of methane. DEP beneficially uses approximately 40% of the produced anaerobic digester gas (ADG). These efforts support the reduction target set by PlaNYC, where city government buildings are to reduce their GHG emissions by 30% by 2017 from a 2005 baseline. Internally, DEP has implemented a Standard Operating Procedure to govern energy conservation and GHG reduction design considerations during the project design lifecycle, from the selection of the designer to commissioning of the installed equipment. Energy design guidelines for unit processes or equipment accompany the SOP and provide guidance on how to increase energy efficiency with any new facility construction or reconstruction projects.

At the Owl’s Head WWTP, there are three 1.6 MW dual fuel engines to generate electricity at the plant which offset approximately 40% of the plant’s electric needs. Moreover, The Coney Island WWTP has four 1.6 MW engine generators. These cogeneration units have been in service for over 30 years. The plant is generating over 80% of total electric power from these engines and utilizes nearly 100% digester gas production at plant. Looking ahead, DEP is designing a 16 MW cogeneration system at the North River WWTP which will be operated at an average of 10 MW and will use ADG and utility natural gas. The system, which will be in operation by 2020, will meet the plant’s base electrical demand and all thermal heating needs.

Green Stormwater Infrastructure

The DEP 2015 Green Infrastructure Annual Report states that NYC committed a total of $1.5 billion to installing Green Infrastructure throughout the next 20 years, from 2010 to 2030. In 2015, the DEP also began a Research and Development Program (R&D) that will build on existing monitoring and substantially expand DEP’s ability to collect new data on green infrastructure performance.

The city has a sustainable stormwater management plan that includes 30 pilot projects to test promising source control technologies. Changes to city building codes and zoning since the launch of PlaNYC include zoning amendments initiated by the Department of City Planning, requiring new commercial parking lots to include perimeter and interior green infrastructure, prohibiting buildings in lower-density districts from having paved yards, and requiring new developments city-wide to include street trees and, in lower-density areas, include sidewalk planting strips.

In 2013, DEP worked the Department of Buildings and other city agencies to extend the 2008 New York City Green Roof Tax Abatement—with some modifications—for an additional five years. This provides a one-year tax abatement, or tax relief, of $4.50 per square foot (up to $100,000 or the building's tax liability, whichever is less) to property owners that install green roofs.

","Water Efficiency

The city of Phoenix is a major contributor to the Water Use It Wisely campaign, an educational campaign aimed at increasing water efficiency across Phoenix. As a result, water use per capita has dropped 34% since 1996 and 6% in the last two years. The city also retrofits 200-250 income-qualified homes with high-efficiency fixtures and toilets. Currently, the energy and water utilities do not offer joint efficiency programs to residential or commercial customers. Additionally, the City has set nonrevenue water-saving goals at their water department, which are aimed at keeping annual water losses below 10%.

Energy Efficiency and Self-Generation

The Water Services Department (WSD) partners with local electric service providers to implement energy conservation measures at its facilities. To date, energy conservation measures from these programs have saved 5.8 million kWh annually. The WSD has joined the Department of Energy’s Better Plans Program, setting a goal to reduce energy intensity (KWh/million gallons) by 25% over a 10-year period, baseline year 2015. It is also participating in the DOE’s Wastewater Infrastructure Accelerator through the Better Buildings Program. Additionally, the Water Services Department Business Plan establishes energy intensity metrics for both its water and wastewater operations. To meet them, an aggressive program is being implemented to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions through a holistic approach that includes new technologies, alternative energy resources, and innovative management techniques.

Digester gas is used at the 91st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Facility, in boilers to maintain digester temperatures, offsetting its thermal load by 68,000 MMBtu per year. Additionally, a large Energy Services Company (ESCO) is under contract to build and operate a facility recovery and clean-up digester gas that is currently being flared. The project had a ground breaking ceremony in the fall of 2016, with anticipated completion by December 2017. When operational, the facility will provide an annual energy offset of approximately 640,000 MMBtu, reducing carbon emissions by nearly 45,000 tons/year, which is the equivalent of taking over 70,000 cars off the road or planting over 87,000 acres of trees every year.

Energy Efficiency and Self-Generation

At this time, the City of Riverside has not established a goal for energy efficiency across municipal water service operations. The wastewater division of the Riverside Public Works Department self-generates electricity by capturing methane generated from the wastewater treatment plant’s anaerobic digesters. Methane is currently burned in internal combustion engines for power generation. Each engine drives a 1.1 MW generator. Waste heat is captured in an onsite heat loop which is used for process heat for the anaerobic digesters and for an onsite chiller which cools the administration and laboratory building. 

Green Stormwater Infrastructure

To improve water quality, the city implements many measures, including stormwater pollution management and urban runoff management. The city’s efforts are guided, in part, by federal and state regulations including the Clean Water Act and the National Pollution Elimination System (NPDES) program. One way the city is working to improve water quality is by reducing the pollution and water flowing from the city’s storm drain system towards the Santa Ana River. In 2008, the city approved the Riverside Recycle Water Project, which will use highly treated wastewater rather than high-quality potable water to serve the agricultural and irrigation needs throughout the city.

The 2010 Santa Ana River MS4 Permit (Permit) requires that a Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) be prepared for all projects within the City which meet certain categories/thresholds and for which a final map or permit for discretionary approval is sought from the City. These requirements are also codified in the City’s Municipal Code.

The WQCP and Permit mandate a Low Impact Development (LID) approach to stormwater treatment and management of runoff from Priority Development Projects. LID comprises a set of technologically feasible and cost-effective approaches to stormwater management and land development. A LID approach is consistent with green infrastructure in that it includes, among others, technologies such as onsite infiltration, harvest and reuse, and permeable pavement.

In April 2015, the San Jose City Council set a mandated 30% water conservation target, which stayed in effect until July 2016. As the water supply was replenished, San Jose City Council declared a 20% water conservation target in July 2016, which will stay in effect until January 31, 2017. San Jose residents and businesses reached a 28% water conservation level between August 2015 and August 2016. This is slightly under the City’s 30% water conservation target but above the state’s target of 25%. All conservation targets are measured against the baseline year of 2013. 

With the reduction in the target on July 1, water use has increased; however, San Jose Municipal Water System continues to implement its enhanced water conservation outreach efforts. San Jose’s General Plan also outlines specific water savings targets, which include reducing citywide per capita water consumption by 25% by 2040 below 2010 levels, and achieving 50 million gallons per day of water conservation savings in San Jose, by reducing water use and increasing water-use efficiency by 2040.

The wastewater utility has also installed LED streetlights throughout its 170-acre campus, and it continues to evaluate additional energy conservation measures. In addition, the wastewater utility is undergoing a $1.4 billion, 10-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP). The CIP has plans to invest in energy efficiency projects including $36.4 million aeration tanks rehabilitation and blower improvement projects which will reduce up to 40% of kWh and $1 million annually in secondary treatment once these projects are completed. The wastewater utility self-generates approximately half its energy supply through the capture and use of digester gas.

Since 2011, through a Mayor's announcement, Seattle has had a goal to achieve 20% energy savings in municipal buildings by 2020 from a 2008 baseline. A citywide Resource Conservation Management Plan (RCMP), adopted by City Council Resolution 31491 in December 2013, outlines strategies for achieving the goal. Municipal energy efficiency retrofits were completed on 19 buildings in 2011 through 2013 through an energy services contract. In 2013 through 2014, operations improvements were made on 19 facilities. The 2013 Resource Conservation Management Plan includes continued capital and operations improvement strategies, along with ongoing building analyses to identify future opportunities. As part of that plan, $3 million is dedicated to capital energy efficiency projects in 14 facilities in 2015-2016, with additional funding for operations improvements and measurement and verification.

Seattle City Light collaborates with Seattle Public Utilities on joint energy and water efficiency programs, often focusing on water heating.

Seattle has set a goal in its Water System Plan to reduce total average annual retail water use. The SWP has set a six-year regional conservation goal: reduce per capita use from current levels so that the SWP’s total average annual retail water use is less than 105 million gallons of water daily (mgd) from 2013 through 2018 despite forecasted population growth. In order to meet the goal, the amount of water used per person will need to decrease to offset growth. For 2015, the Saving Water Partnership met the goal, using 96.9 mgd.

Energy Efficiency and Self-Generation

The Wastewater Treatment utility, operated by King County, has an energy conservation goal of 2% per year from a 2007 baseline. Additionally, Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) has a program that is updating and modernizing its water and drainage and wastewater pump stations.

","","12 out of 20 points","The Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO), an investor-owned utility, is the primary electric utility serving Washington, DC. Washington Gas is Washington’s primary natural gas utility. The DC Council adopted the Clean and Affordable Energy Act which implemented a DC Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) to run energy efficiency programs (electric and natural gas) to meet the city council-required performance benchmarks. To learn more about the District’s requirements for electric and gas efficiency, please visit the District of Columbia page of the State Database.

DC Water provides Washington DC with drinking water services and wastewater treatment. The District Department of the Environment manages stormwater for the district.

","In 2015, according to PEPCO and DCSEU, together they achieved 57,208 MWh in net incremental savings, representing 0.51% of retail sales. To achieve these savings, PEPCO and DCSEU spent $13,300,507 on electric efficiency programs in 2015, which equates to 1.83% of annual revenue. In 2015, Washington Gas and DCSEU reported savings of 0.07 MMtherms from natural gas efficiency programs, representing 0.88% of its retail sales. To achieve these savings, Washington Gas and DCSEU spent $5,395,764 on natural gas efficiency programs, which are normalized to $36.48 per residential customer. The figures represented here cover all of the District of Columbia. DCSEU offers electric and natural gas efficiency incentives and technical assistance to residential and business customers.

Green Energy DC is the District of Columbia's resource for information on energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, products and services in the District. Green Energy DC is a service of the DDOE. Authorized under the Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 (CAEA), DDOE contracts with a private entity to conduct sustainable energy programs on behalf of the District government. The CAEA also established a DC Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) to be the one-stop resource for energy efficiency and renewable energy services for District residents and businesses.  The DCSEU serves under a performance-based contract with DDOE, with input and recommendations from the DCSEU Advisory Board, and oversight from the Council of the District of Columbia.

The District partners with DCSEU, PEPCO, and Washington Gas to promote participation in the energy efficiency programs. The District’s Department of the Environment (DDOE) conducts outreach on all of its sustainability programs on a regular basis. DDOE also works closely with the DC SEU to refer low-income customers who come in through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program or the Weatherization ion Assistance Program to the DC SEU for additional energy efficiency services.

In addition, DDOE shares benchmarking data with the DCSEU. The DCSEU uses this raw data to highlight trends and identify customer segments with the greatest potential for cost-effective and significant energy savings. The DCSEU can then use the benchmarking data to target its services and incentives to customers with the greatest need. The DCSEU has been able to utilize the benchmarking data to improve the design of its Commercial & Institutional programs.

","In order for customers to access their own energy data, PEPCO makes use of the Green Button data sharing platform. Residential customers can download a spreadsheet or XML file of their 15-minute-interval electricity data (“Green Button Download my Data”), and commercial customers can access a next-day Application Programming Interface (API) feed of their 15-minute interval consumption data (“Green Button Connect My Data.”), becoming the first utility in the country to implement this feature. The utilities do provide the region with detailed electricity and natural gas consumption data by zip code.

The District government has advocated strongly for improvements in data provision by utilities to building owners and to the city. DDOE worked closely with Pepco to get Pepco to offer aggregated whole building data beginning in 2013. DCSEU operated a Benchmarking Help Center in 2013 and 2014 that helped 70% of buildings with their reporting and improved their efficiency. DOEE now directly manages the help center, with support from DCSEU. The District and Pepco also partner on the Department of Energy's Better Buildings Initiative, Energy Data Accelerator, to facilitate better access to energy usage data.

The District of Columbia mandated, in the Sustainable DC Act of 2014, that both electric and gas utilities provide aggregated whole-building data upon request to a building owner, and also provide automated benchmarking services to upload that data to ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager®. The District was the first jurisdiction in the nation to put such a requirement into law.

Pepco now provides automated upload of whole building electricity data to Portfolio Manager, using a service called “Resource Advisor” which went online in Fall 2014. Once set up, up to two years of historical data can be uploaded, and electricity data is updated on monthly basis thereafter.  Data is aggregated to the whole building level for five or more accounts, in order to protect privacy while easing the processes of benchmarking multi-tenant buildings. There is no fee for the service.

Washington Gas also offers aggregated whole building data for buildings with five or more gas accounts to building owners as required by the law. Automated upload to Portfolio Manager of Natural Gas data is not yet available, but must be provided by the end of 2017.

","Water Efficiency

The District of Columbia offers water efficiency programs separately from the energy utilities. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DC Water) developed the award-winning High Usage Notification Application (HUNA) as a free service to proactively notify customers of high water use - including unknown household leaks, sprinklers accidentally left running or ruptured washing machine hoses. The HUNA has generated more than 18,000 notifications to customers since January 2006. 

Washington has the goal to decrease total water use by 40% by the end of 2032. DC Water is committed to protecting and preserving the national and local water supply through encouraging water-efficient practices, products, and services. By partnering with the EPA’s WaterSense program, DC Water will offer consumers useful water-saving techniques and encourage them to look for WaterSense labeled products, when making product choices. These products use about 20% less water and perform as well as, or better than, conventional models.

Energy Efficiency and Self-Generation

DC Water has pursued several projects to reduce energy used for wastewater treatment. They have systematically retrofitted diffuser equipment at the Blue Plains treatment to significantly reduce energy consumed through the treatment process. They have also been improving tidal gates on an ongoing basis to reduce infiltration and water treatment volume.

DC Water, the regional water utility, operates an anaerobic digester to generate electricity and steam from solid waste. The energy facility at the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant uses the solids left over at the end of the wastewater treatment process to create electricity and steam. The project reduces the energy needs of the massive plant by about a third. DC Water expects to expand the capacity and efficiency of the system to meet even more of their energy load in the near future. The Bioenergy facility opened in 2015. It uses thermal hydrolysis to maximize anaerobic digestion.  Blue Plains is the first site in North America to utilize this technology. In recognition of this project, the District of Columbia and DC Water were one of four finalists from across the globe in the “clean energy” category in the C40 Cities awards in December 2016. 

Green Stormwater Infrastructure

Finalized in 2012, the Sustainable DC Plan discusses ways to encourage the use of green infrastructure to manage stormwater. The Plan discusses using green infrastructure such as permeable pavement, bioswales, dense tree plantings, and other low impact development to capture pollutants before they reach the rivers. The second goal in the plan is to use 75% of the landscape to capture rainwater for filtration or reuse by 2032. The District also provides subsidies to properties that install green infrastructure through the “RiverSmart Program”, including green roofs, rain gardens, trees, and impermeable surfaces.

In 2013, the District issued the 2013 Rule on Stormwater Management and Soil Erosion and Sediment Control that establishes stormwater retention and performance standards for new development. The rule also created the Stormwater Retention Credit (SRC) Trading Program, the first of its kind in the nation. Properties throughout the District can generate Stormwater Retention Credits (SRCs) for voluntary green infrastructure projects that reduce stormwater runoff. Owners can then trade their SRCs in an open market to others who use them to meet the regulatory requirements for retaining stormwater.
